My Python Projects
This repository contains a collection of short Python projects that I have created. Each project is contained in its own folder within the repository.

# Projects
Here is a list of the projects in this repository:
bmi.py - A simple calculator that calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on your height and weight.

Detention.py - A program that helps teachers and school administrators manage student detentions. It allows them to assign detentions, track student attendance, and generate reports.

Grades.py - A program that allows teachers to manage student grades. It enables them to add students, create assignments, record grades, and generate reports.

Guess_number.py - A game where the computer generates a random number, and the user has to guess the number within a certain number of attempts. The game provides hints and feedback to help the user make their guesses.

Currency.py - A Python program that performs currency conversion. It allows users to input an amount in one currency and converts it to another currency based on the current exchange rate.

Hypotenuse.py - A Python program that calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. Users can input the lengths of the two shorter sides, and the program uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the hypotenuse.

Magic8.py - A Python program that simulates a Magic 8-Ball. It randomly generates and displays answers to yes-or-no questions. Users can input their questions, and the program provides a random response, as if consulting a Magic 8-Ball.

pH_Levels.py - A Python program that determines the pH level of a substance. Users can input the pH value, and the program provides information on whether the substance is acidic, neutral, or alkaline, based on predefined pH ranges.
